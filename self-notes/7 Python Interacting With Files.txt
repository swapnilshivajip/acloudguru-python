Working with files:

open("file_path", mode)		- open file with given mode
modes:
r	- open for reading (default)
w	- open for writing, truncating the file first
x	- open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists
a	- open for writing or appending to the end of the file if it exists
b	- binary mode
t	- text mode (default)
+	- open a disk file for updating 


example:

1. writing:
	my_file = open("demo.txt", "w+")
	my_file.write("Beast\n")
	my_file.write("Pheonix\n")
	my_file.writelines([
					"Beast\n",
					"Bishop\n",
					"Cyclops\n",
				])
	my_file.close()			


2. reading:
	my_file = open("demo.txt")
	print(my_file.read())		- 	cursor moves to last line last char after reading
	my_file.seek(0)				-	resetting the cursor back to 0th position to read it again
	print(my_file.read())		- 	re-read file
	my_file.close()
	
	OR
	
	#read without explicit closing
	my_file = open("demo.txt")
	with my_file:
		print(my_file.read())

3. write to file and automatically close the file without using close()
	with open("demo.txt", "w+") as my_file:
		my_file = open("demo.txt", "w+")
		my_file.write("Beast\n")
		my_file.write("Pheonix\n")
		my_file.writelines([
						"Beast\n",
						"Bishop\n",
						"Cyclops\n",
					])
		my_file.close()
